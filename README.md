##User Story
This application was created for students who are studying Javascript in order to help them review and understand concepts from the unit. By gamifying the coding process, this quiz not only helps students become more flexible in thier skills but also helps them understand the material in a fun way! 

##The website
The website is a quiz. When the user clicks the start button the website takes the user to the first question, and begins a timer. Throughout the quiz, the user coninues to have the timer displayed so they know how much time is left. When the user answers a question incorrectly, it will subtract 15 seconds from the time. If the user answers many correctly, it will also show this. At the end, the user will be prompted to enter thier initials to keep thier score. 

##Description of process
The website itself is created using javascript. I began this process by beginning with understanding the user expeerience. I then created the variables and functions, using many different commands and functions. Initially, my code was over 200 lines long. However, because of repetition, I was able to combine this information into loops and functions in order to streamline the code.
